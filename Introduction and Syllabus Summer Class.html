<h1 class="title" id="title">Graphing with GGPlot Introduction and Syllabus</h1>
<h2>Welcome to Graphing with GGPlot</h2>
<p>The main purpose of this class is to learn how to create robust plots in R using GGPlot. GGPlot is a widely used R package that adopts a modern approach to graphing that makes plots more extensible and reusable and it also has one of the largest, and most active, R communities. The class will also focus on good programming practices and include a variety of topics concerning plotting in R including but not limited to pattern recognition (grep), RGB color codes and Unicode characters, gradients, and quantiles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a 1-credit class and the expectation is that you will spend about 60 hours overall on the class -- this time includes the class meetings.</p>
<h3>Class Times and location</h3>
<p>The course will be held online using Zoom every<em><strong> Monday from 3-5</strong></em> for 7 weeks between June 29 and August 13.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We will be meeting on Zoom here:</p>
<p><a href="https://msu.zoom.us/j/94245763600">https://msu.zoom.us/j/94245763600</a></p>
<p>Password: ggplot</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>This class is designed for students that have some programming experience, whether in R or another language (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++). The experience needed is about the equivalent of one semester of programming &ndash; or an understanding of functions, if-else statements, and for loops.&nbsp; You will need a laptop with the newest versions of R (3.6.3 or 4.0+) and RStudio (1.2+).</p>
<h3>Material</h3>
<p>All material for this course is either in D2L or GitHub -- no textbooks are required.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://qfcatmsu.github.io/GGPlot/Lessons/01-02%20Components.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here is a sample lesson from the course.</a></p>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>The class is graded under the Pass-No Grade system.&nbsp; The two criteria for evaluation is class participation and the <a href="https://github.com/QFCatMSU/GGPlot-Class-Material/raw/master/Class%20Project%20Rubric.docx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">class project</a>.</p>

<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>About me...</strong></p>
<p>I started my career as a Software Engineer for Motorola in Arizona where I developed software for military radios. From there I became a high school teacher in Port Huron, MI where I taught Computer Science, Web Design, and Physical Science. After that, I worked as an Instructional Designer for the College of Education at MSU where my main project was developing the hybrid graduate program. I currently work at the Quantitative Fisheries Center where my primary job is developing online classes, including this one.&nbsp; In my free time you will often find me with a backpack deep in a forest or, as my picture testifies to, hanging out on a mountain in the Northern Cascades.</p>
<h2>Class Structure</h2>
<p>The class will be styled similar to a flipped classroom where students will go through the lessons before class and the class period will be used to present the material in alternatives ways, teach extensions to the material, and to allow student to work together on the lesson applications and their class projects.&nbsp; <em class="hl">It is expected that students will come to class having read through the lesson and made a good effort on the lesson application</em>.</p>
<h3>Lessons</h3>
<p>The course has 10 lessons divided up over the 7 weeks, the exact order of lessons might change during the course.<strong></strong></p>
<p></p>

<h3>Lesson Application</h3>
<p>Every lesson has an <em><strong>Application</strong> </em>section at the end that will ask you to apply the skills taught in the lesson to your own script.&nbsp; The applications are not graded and the answers are provided on the GitHub page for the class.&nbsp; <em><strong></strong></em></p>
<h3>Extensions and Traps</h3>
<p class="">Many of the lessons contain optional content called <em><strong>Extension</strong> </em>and <em><strong>Traps</strong></em>.&nbsp; Extensions contain material that goes beyond the lesson's objectives and Traps capture some of the common issues students have with the lesson's objectives.&nbsp; There are links to <em><strong>Extensions</strong> </em>and <em><strong>Traps</strong> </em>within the Content area of the lesson.&nbsp; Clicking on the appropriate link takes you directly to the <em><strong>Extension</strong> </em>or <em><strong>Trap.</strong></em> <em class="ref" id="r-test"> Extension: testing the extension link</em>.</p>
<h3>Class Project</h3>
<p><em class="hl">The only product that will be evaluated is your class project.</em>&nbsp; Your class project is to use the skills taught in this class with your own data.&nbsp; The class project is meant to be an ongoing assignment that you update as you learn the skills taught in the lessons.&nbsp; If you do not have your own data you can find a dataset online -- there are many datasets that are freely available online<a href="https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> including hundreds at this website</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/QFCatMSU/GGPlot-Class-Material/raw/master/Class%20Project%20Rubric.docx" target="_self" class="download">More information and the rubric for the class project is here</a>.</p>

<h3>Accessing the class</h3>
<p>You need an MSU ID or MSU Guest ID to access the class material in D2L.</p>
<ol></ol>
<h2>Lesson features</h2>
<p>This sections goes over some of the technological features built into the D2L lessons.</p>
<h3>Resizing Pictures</h3>
<p>Most pictures in the course can be resized so that the picture is out of your way when you don't need to view it.&nbsp; Clicking on the picture toggles it between the minimized and maximized states (<em class="ref" id="r-resizeImg">fig ##</em>).</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="../Images/NinhBinh%20(Large).jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" class="fs" /></p>
<h5 class="" id="resizeImg">Test picture to toggle (Ninh B&igrave;nh, Việt Nam)</h5>
<h3>Figures and references</h3>
<p>When you click on a figure reference, the caption on the figure will highlight for 2 seconds.&nbsp; If the figure is not on the screen, then the page will scroll to the figure and highlight it.&nbsp; For instance, clicking on <em class="ref" id="r-zoom">fig ##</em> will take you to the Zoom figure near the top of this page.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Printing lessons and saving lessons to PDF</h3>
<p>You can print any lesson or save it as a PDF by clicking on the <em><strong>Printer</strong> icon</em> at the top of every lesson (and this syllabus).&nbsp; This will bring up a print dialog (<em class="ref" id="r-pdf">fig ##</em>) and you can print the lesson to a printer.&nbsp; On most machines, you can also choose a PDF device as a printer -- this will save the lesson as a PDF document.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p class="note">Note: Using your browser's print feature instead of the <em><strong>Print</strong> </em>link will print out the whole webpage instead of just the lesson.</p>
<h4>Print-to-PDF Software</h4>
<p>If you are using Windows 7 or 8 you might not have a PDF device and you will need to download <em><strong>Print-to-PDF</strong> </em>software. You can see if you have a PDF device by going to the print options in any program and see if any of the devices have "PDF" in their name (<em class="ref" id="r-pdf">fig ##</em>).&nbsp; If you don't have a PDF device, then I recommend you install&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/products/cutepdf/writer.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CutePDF </a>(direct link to the <a href="http://cutepdf.com/download/CuteWriter.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">file download</a>).&nbsp; CutePDF is simple print-to-PDF software that does not try to install any extra software on your computer. <em class="ref" id="r-offers">Trap: Bloatware<br /></em></p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="../Images/R-00-PDFPrinter.PNG" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" class="fs" /></p>
<h5 class="" id="pdf">This author has two print-to-PDF devices -- the Microsoft Print to PDF, which comes with Windows 10, works fine</h5>
<h3>Long-click menu</h3>
<p>If you long-click (hold left-button for about half a second) anywhere on any lesson page (<em class="ref" id="r-ff">fig ##, </em>try it!), you are given options to:</p>
<ul>
<li>print the lesson (same as the lesson's <em><strong>Print</strong> </em>link)</li>
<li>go to the top of the page</li>
<li>return to the previous location</li>
<li>maximize all pictures</li>
<li>minimize all pictures</li>
<li>edit page (for admins only)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>In Firefox, the options above are also included in the right-click menu.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="../Images/R-00-LongClickMenu.PNG" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" class="fs" /></p>
<h5 id="ff">The long-click menu -- this view is from Firefox .</h5>
<h3>Copying codeblocks</h3>
<p>Double-clicking on a codeblock will select all the text in the codeblock and copy it to the clipboard -- you can then paste it into RStudio (or any other text editor).&nbsp;</p>
<h6># the next two lines should be at the top of all your scripts</h6>
<h6>rm(list=ls());&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>options(show.error.locations = TRUE);</h6>
<h6></h6>
<h6># create three variables: d, t, and v</h6>
<h6># give d and t values and use them to calculate v</h6>
<h6>d = 100;</h6>
<h6>t = 20;</h6>
<h6>v = d/t;</h6>
<h5 class="" id="fullCode">Double clicking on the codeblock selects all the text and copies it to the clipboard</h5>
<h2 class="trap" id="offers">Trap: Bloatware</h2>
<p>Adobe Acrobat, like most free software you download, attempts to bundle itself with software you most likely do not need nor want (i.e., bloatware).&nbsp; Make sure you always take time to read the optional offers whenever you download software. This author would argue that the main reason computers "slow" down over time is because of extra software that users unwittingly install.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="../Images/R-00-Bloatware.PNG" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" class="fs" /></p>
<h5>Three offers from Adobe that you neither need nor want -- this author recommends you uncheck them all.</h5>
<h2 class="extension" id="test">Extension: Testing the extension link.</h2>
<p>Hi, and welcome to the test <em><strong>Extension</strong></em>.&nbsp; If you clicked on the <em><strong>Extension</strong> </em>link to get here then you can return to your previous location by long-clicking on this page and choosing <em><strong>Return to Previous Location</strong></em>.</p>
