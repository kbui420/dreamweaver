<p class="nextLesson">GGPlot Installation and Setup</p>
<h1 class="title" id="title">Introduction and Syllabus</h1>
<h2>Welcome to Graphing with GGPlot</h2>
<p>The purpose of this class is to introduce students to the graphing package in R called GGPlot2 and the modularization techniques used by GGPlot2 to create plots.&nbsp; GGPlot2, developed by Hadley Wickham, is a powerful data visualization tool used to make publication-quality plots and it has one of the largest, and most active, R communities.&nbsp; GGPlot2 differs from other graphing packages by separating a plot into its component parts, making the code for the plot more reusable and extensible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This class uses RStudio and is designed for students who have at least a basic background in programming -- the equivalent of one semester of R, or any similar programming language (e.g., Visual Basic, JavaScript, C++).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Graphing with GGPlot is a self-paced and asynchronous online class. The amount of material in the class is about the same as a 1.5 credit, one semester class and students are expected to complete the class within three months.&nbsp; There are no regularly scheduled office hours but you can email or call the instructor to ask questions or set up a meeting.&nbsp; All contacts will receive a response within one business day.</p>

<p><strong>About me...</strong></p>
<p>I started my career as a Software Engineer for Motorola in Arizona where I developed software for military radios. From there I became a high school teacher in Port Huron, MI where I taught Computer Science, Web Design, and Physical Science. After that, I worked as an Instructional Designer for the College of Education at MSU where my main project was developing the hybrid graduate program. I currently work at the QFC where my primary job is developing online classes, including this one.&nbsp; In my free time you will often find me with a backpack deep in a forest or, as my picture testifies to, hanging out on a mountain in the Northern Cascades.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Students should be familiar with basic programming structures like <em><strong>if...else</strong></em>, <em><strong>for()</strong></em>, and <em><strong>functions</strong> </em>-- material covered in a typical first semester programming class.&nbsp; All material for this course is online -- no textbooks are required.</p>
<h3>Tech requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Hardware:</strong>&nbsp; Any Windows, Mac, or Linux machine from the past ten years that has updates installed can handle all the hardware and software requirements of this class.&nbsp; Preferably the computer has a webcam and microphone for videoconferencing.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Browser:</strong> <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox is recommended</a>.&nbsp; You can use any browser (Edge, Chrome, Safari, Firefox) updated within the last couple years to view, navigate, and complete the whole course but some of the advanced navigation features can only be used in Firefox.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Videoconferencing</strong>: We use <a href="http://zoom.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom </a>for our videoconference meetings.&nbsp; The meeting link will be emailed to you prior to the meeting.&nbsp; It is recommend that you download and test your camera and microphone on Zoom before attending an instructor meeting.&nbsp; The easiest way to to this is to go to the <a href="https://zoom.us/test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom test page</a>.&nbsp; <em class="note">Note: Zoom's test page will download Zoom for you.</em></p>
<div>

</ol>
<h3>Lesson Application</h3>
<p>Every lesson has an <em><strong>Application</strong> </em>section at the end that will ask you to apply what you learned in the lesson in your own script.&nbsp; The applications are not graded and the answers are provided on the GitHub page for the class.&nbsp; However,<em class="hl"> it is highly recommended that you email your applications to the instructor. </em>Emailing instructions are given in the applications.&nbsp;<em><strong></strong></em></p>
<h3>Extensions and Traps</h3>
<p class="">Many of the lessons contain optional content called <em><strong>Extension</strong> </em>and <em><strong>Traps</strong></em>.&nbsp; Extensions contain material that goes beyond the lesson's objectives and Traps capture some of the common issues students have with the lesson's objectives.&nbsp; There are links to <em><strong>Extensions</strong> </em>and <em><strong>Traps</strong> </em>within the Content area of the lesson.&nbsp; Clicking on the appropriate link takes you directly to the <em><strong>Extension</strong> </em>or <em><strong>Trap.</strong></em> <em class="ref" id="r-test"> Extension: testing the extension link</em>.</p>
<h3>Class Project</h3>
<p><em class="hl">The only product that will be evaluated is your class project.</em>&nbsp; Your class project is to use the skills taught in this class with your own data.&nbsp; The class project is meant to be an ongoing assignment that you update as you learn the skills taught in the lessons.&nbsp; If you do not have your own data you can find a dataset online -- there are many datasets that are freely available online<a href="https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> including hundreds at this website</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/QFCatMSU/GGPlot-Class-Material/raw/master/Class%20Project%20Rubric.docx" target="_self" class="download">More information and the rubric for the class project is here</a>.</p>
<h3>Downloading material for the class</h3>
<p>All material used in the class is available at this&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/QFCatMSU/GGPlot-Class-Material" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub page</a> including:</p>
<ul>
<li>script and data files used in the lessons</li>
<li>answers to all the lesson applications</li>
<li>PDF (offline) versions of all the lessons</li>
</ul>
<h2>Student-Instructor Meetings</h2>
<p>Student-instructor meetings will be done on an as-needed basis and meetings can always be requested by the student.&nbsp; Meetings are done preferably using Zoom so that screens can be shared.</p>
<ol></ol>
<h2>Lesson features</h2>
<p>This sections goes over some of the technological features built into the lessons.</p>
<h3>Resizing Pictures</h3>
<p>Most pictures in the course can be resized so that the picture is out of your way when you don't need to view it.&nbsp; Clicking on the picture toggles it between the minimized and maximized states (<em class="ref" id="r-resizeImg">fig ##</em>).</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="../Images/NinhBinh%20(Large).jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" class="fs"></p>
<h5 class="" id="resizeImg">Test picture to toggle (Ninh Bình, Việt Nam)</h5>
<h3>Figures and references</h3>
<p>When you click on a figure reference, the caption on the figure will highlight for 2 seconds.&nbsp; If the figure is not on the screen, then the page will scroll to the figure and highlight it.&nbsp; For instance, clicking on <em class="ref" id="r-zoom">fig ##</em> will take you to the Zoom figure near the top of this page.</p>
<h3>Printing lessons and saving lessons to PDF</h3>
<p>You can print any lesson or save it as a PDF by clicking on the <em><strong>Printer</strong> icon</em> at the top of every lesson (and this syllabus).&nbsp; This will bring up a print dialog (<em class="ref" id="r-pdf">fig ##</em>) and you can print the lesson to a printer.&nbsp; On most machines, you can also choose a PDF device as a printer -- this will save the lesson as a PDF document.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note: Using your browser's print feature instead on the <em><strong>Print</strong> </em>link will print out the whole webpage instead of just the lesson.</p>
<h4>Print-to-PDF Software</h4>
<p>If you are using Windows 7 or 8 you might not have a PDF device and you will need to download <em><strong>Print-to-PDF</strong> </em>software. You can see if you have a PDF device by going to the print options in any program and see if any of the devices have "PDF" in their name (<em class="ref" id="r-pdf">fig ##</em>).&nbsp; If you don't have a PDF device, then I recommend you install&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/products/cutepdf/writer.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CutePDF </a>(direct link to the <a href="http://cutepdf.com/download/CuteWriter.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">file download</a>).&nbsp; CutePDF is simple print-to-PDF software that does not try to install any extra software on your computer. <em class="ref" id="r-offers">Trap: Bloatware<br></em></p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="../Images/R-00-PDFPrinter.PNG" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" class="fs"></p>
<h5 class="" id="pdf">This author has two print-to-PDF devices -- the Microsoft Print to PDF, which comes with Windows 10, works fine</h5>
<h3>Long-click menu</h3>
<p>If you long-click (hold left-button for about half a second) anywhere on any lesson page (<em class="ref" id="r-ff">fig ##, </em>try it!), you are given options to:</p>
<ul>
<li>print the lesson (same as the lesson's <em><strong>Print</strong> </em>link)</li>
<li>go to the top of the page</li>
<li>return to the previous position</li>
<li>maximize all pictures</li>
<li>minimize all pictures</li>
<li>edit page (for admins only)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>In Firefox, the options above are also included in the right-click menu.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="../Images/R-00-LongClickMenu.PNG" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" class="fs"></p>
<h5 id="ff">The long-click menu -- this view is from Firefox .</h5>
<h3>Codeblocks</h3>
<p>Double-clicking on a codeblock will select all the text in the codeblock and copy it to the clipboard -- you can then paste it into RStudio (or any other text editor).&nbsp;</p>
<h6># the next two lines should be at the top of all your scripts</h6>
<h6>rm(list=ls());&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>options(show.error.locations = TRUE);</h6>
<h6></h6>
<h6># create three variables: d, t, and v</h6>
<h6># give d and t values and use them to calculate v</h6>
<h6>d = 100;</h6>
<h6>t = 20;</h6>
<h6>v = d/t;</h6>
<h5 class="" id="fullCode">Double clicking on the codeblock selects all the text and copies it to the clipboard</h5>
<h2>Personal statement from Charlie</h2>
<p>The biggest thing that is lost when you move a class from a face-to-face environment to an online environment is the daily interaction between the instructor and the students.&nbsp; These interactions provide invaluable informal feedback for the instructor and, I would argue, are the main tool that an instructor uses to make improvements to their class.&nbsp; It is impossible to replicate this in an online class but I ask that you help me out and make an effort to communicate to me the little things.&nbsp; This could mean technical nags like content not appearing properly or pages loading too slowly, lesson content that is unclear, grammar and spelling issues, or scripts that does not work or work in a way that you do not understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you for reading and taking this into consideration.&nbsp; In the end, it is the interactions between an instructor and the students that make a class great.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>

<h2 class="trap" id="offers">Trap: Bloatware</h2>
<p>Adobe Acrobat, like most free software you download, attempts to bundle itself with software you most likely do not need nor want (i.e., bloatware).&nbsp; Make sure you take some time to read the optional offers whenever you download software. This author would argue that the main reason computers "slow" down over time is because of extra software that users unwittingly install.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="../Images/R-00-Bloatware.PNG" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" class="fs"></p>
<h5>Three offers from Adobe that you neither need nor want -- this author recommends you uncheck them all.</h5>
